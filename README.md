# K-Anonymity_EDA
This is a repository with the code that I used to draw my conclusions for the EDA section of my CS105 Final Project. In this project, I explored K-anonymity with a medical insurance dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). Please note that this is a dataset in public domain, and was taken from a textbook example. This was cited in the kaggle description to be from the textbook "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz.
